## Debugging Techniques by Problem Type

### Technique 1: Output Quality Issues

#### Problem: Inaccurate or Low-Quality Responses

**Diagnostic Approach:**
```
**QUALITY DEBUGGING FRAMEWORK:**

**Step 1: Accuracy Assessment**
- Fact-check specific claims in the output
- Identify which parts are accurate vs. inaccurate
- Determine if errors are factual, logical, or contextual

**Step 2: Context Analysis**
- Is sufficient context provided for accurate responses?
- Are there missing details that would improve accuracy?
- Is the AI making reasonable assumptions or wild guesses?

**Step 3: Instruction Clarity**
- Are quality standards explicitly defined?
- Do you provide examples of good vs. poor quality?
- Are success criteria measurable and specific?

**Step 4: Verification Integration**
Add verification steps to your prompt:
"Before providing your final answer, verify that:
- All facts are accurate and up-to-date
- Claims are supported by evidence
- Recommendations are practical and actionable
- The response directly addresses the question asked"
```

#### Example Fix:
```
**Original Prompt:**
Analyze our competitor's marketing strategy.

**Improved Prompt:**
Analyze [Competitor Name]'s marketing strategy using verified, current information:

**Analysis Framework:**
1. **Channel Strategy**: Where do they advertise and promote?
2. **Messaging Analysis**: What are their key value propositions?
3. **Target Audience**: Who are they trying to reach?
4. **Content Strategy**: What types of content do they create?
5. **Competitive Positioning**: How do they differentiate?

**Information Sources:**
- Their website and official communications
- Recent press releases and announcements
- Social media presence and engagement
- Industry reports and third-party analysis

**Quality Requirements:**
- Cite specific examples and evidence
- Distinguish between facts and assumptions
- Note information gaps or limitations
- Provide actionable insights, not just observations

**Verification Checklist:**
Before finalizing, confirm:
- All claims are supported by evidence
- Information is current (within last 6 months)
- Analysis is objective and balanced
- Recommendations are specific and actionable
```

### Technique 2: Format and Structure Problems

#### Problem: Output Doesn't Match Requested Format

**Diagnostic Approach:**
```
**FORMAT DEBUGGING PROCESS:**

**Step 1: Format Specification Review**
- Is the desired format clearly described?
- Are formatting requirements specific enough?
- Do you provide examples of the desired format?

**Step 2: Constraint Analysis**
- Are there conflicting format requirements?
- Is the requested format realistic for the content?
- Are length constraints appropriate?

**Step 3: Template Creation**
Provide explicit templates and examples:

**Template Example:**
```
## [Section Title]

**Key Point 1:** [Specific information]
- Supporting detail A
- Supporting detail B

**Key Point 2:** [Specific information]
- Supporting detail A
- Supporting detail B

**Summary:** [2-sentence conclusion]
```

**Step 4: Format Validation**
Add format checking to your prompt:
"Ensure your response follows this exact format:
- Use markdown headers for sections
- Include bullet points for details
- Keep each section under 100 words
- End with a summary paragraph"
```

### Technique 3: Consistency Issues

#### Problem: Similar Prompts Produce Different Results

**Diagnostic Approach:**
```
**CONSISTENCY DEBUGGING FRAMEWORK:**

**Step 1: Variable Identification**
- What elements change between similar prompts?
- Which parts of the prompt might be interpreted differently?
- Are there ambiguous terms or instructions?

**Step 2: Standardization**
Create consistent prompt templates:

**Template Structure:**
```
**Role:** [Specific role with expertise level]
**Context:** [Relevant background information]
**Task:** [Specific action to perform]
**Requirements:** [Detailed specifications]
**Format:** [Exact output structure]
**Constraints:** [Limitations and boundaries]
```

**Step 3: Testing Protocol**
Test prompt variations systematically:
- Run the same prompt multiple times
- Test with slight variations in wording
- Document which elements affect consistency
- Identify the most stable prompt formulation

**Step 4: Constraint Tightening**
Add specific constraints to reduce variability:
"Always begin with [specific opening]"
"Use exactly [number] examples"
"Follow this decision tree: If X, then Y"
```

### Technique 4: Scope and Focus Problems

#### Problem: Responses Are Too Broad or Too Narrow

**Scope Debugging Process:**
```
**SCOPE CALIBRATION FRAMEWORK:**

**For Too Broad Responses:**
1. **Add Specific Constraints:**
   - Limit to specific aspects or categories
   - Define exact boundaries and exclusions
   - Provide specific focus areas

2. **Use Filtering Instructions:**
   "Focus only on [specific area]"
   "Exclude [irrelevant topics]"
   "Prioritize [most important aspects]"

**For Too Narrow Responses:**
1. **Expand Context:**
   - Provide broader background information
   - Include related areas to consider
   - Ask for comprehensive coverage

2. **Use Expansion Instructions:**
   "Consider all relevant aspects including..."
   "Explore both direct and indirect impacts"
   "Think broadly about implications"

**Example Scope Calibration:**
```
**Too Broad Original:**
"Analyze our business performance."

**Scope-Calibrated Version:**
"Analyze our Q3 2024 business performance focusing specifically on:
- Revenue growth vs. targets (primary focus)
- Customer acquisition and retention metrics
- Operational efficiency improvements
- Key performance indicators vs. industry benchmarks

Exclude: Long-term strategic planning, competitive analysis, or financial projections beyond Q4 2024.

Provide specific metrics, identify 2-3 key insights, and recommend 2 immediate actions."
```

## Advanced Debugging Strategies

### Strategy 1: A/B Testing for Prompts

```
**PROMPT A/B TESTING FRAMEWORK:**

**Test Setup:**
Create two versions of your prompt with one key difference:

**Version A (Control):**
[Original prompt]

**Version B (Test):**
[Modified prompt with single change]

**Testing Protocol:**
1. Run each version 5 times with same input
2. Evaluate outputs against success criteria
3. Document quality, consistency, and relevance
4. Identify which version performs better

**Example A/B Test:**
**Variable:** Level of detail in instructions

**Version A:** "Write a product description for our new smartphone."

**Version B:** "Write a 150-word product description for our new smartphone targeting tech-savvy consumers aged 25-40. Focus on camera capabilities, performance, and design. Use an enthusiastic but professional tone."

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Relevance to target audience
- Inclusion of key features
- Appropriate tone and length
- Persuasiveness and clarity

**Results Analysis:**
- Version B: 90% met all criteria
- Version A: 40% met all criteria
- Conclusion: Detailed instructions significantly improve output quality
```

### Strategy 2: Iterative Refinement Process

```
**ITERATIVE DEBUGGING PROCESS:**

**Iteration 1: Baseline**
Create initial prompt and evaluate output

**Iteration 2: Single Fix**
Address the most significant issue identified

**Iteration 3: Validation**
Test the fix and identify remaining issues

**Iteration 4: Compound Improvement**
Address multiple issues while maintaining previous improvements

**Example Iterative Process:**
```
**Iteration 1 - Baseline:**
"Help me write a marketing email."

**Output Issues:** Too generic, no clear call-to-action, inappropriate tone

**Iteration 2 - Add Specificity:**
"Write a marketing email for our new project management software targeting small business owners."

**Output Issues:** Better focus, but still lacks structure and urgency

**Iteration 3 - Add Structure:**
"Write a marketing email for our new project management software targeting small business owners. Include: subject line, problem identification, solution benefits, social proof, and clear call-to-action."

**Output Issues:** Good structure, but tone too formal for small business audience

**Iteration 4 - Refine Tone:**
"Write a friendly, conversational marketing email for our new project management software targeting small business owners. Include: compelling subject line, relatable problem identification, clear solution benefits, customer testimonial, and urgent call-to-action with limited-time offer."

**Result:** High-quality, targeted marketing email that addresses all requirements
```

### Strategy 3: Error Pattern Analysis

```
**ERROR PATTERN IDENTIFICATION:**

**Step 1: Error Collection**
Document all prompt failures over time:
- What was the prompt?
- What went wrong?
- What was the expected vs. actual output?

**Step 2: Pattern Recognition**
Look for recurring issues:
- Do certain types of prompts consistently fail?
- Are there common misunderstandings?
- Which models struggle with which tasks?

**Step 3: Root Cause Analysis**
For each pattern, identify:
- Why does this error occur?
- What prompt elements contribute to the problem?
- How can this be prevented in future prompts?

**Common Error Patterns:**
1. **Ambiguous Instructions**: Vague language leads to varied interpretations
2. **Context Overload**: Too much information confuses the focus
3. **Conflicting Requirements**: Contradictory instructions cause confusion
4. **Assumption Gaps**: Missing context leads to incorrect assumptions
5. **Format Complexity**: Overly complex formatting requirements are ignored

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Use specific, unambiguous language
- Prioritize information by importance
- Review for conflicting requirements
- Provide sufficient context
- Simplify formatting requirements
```

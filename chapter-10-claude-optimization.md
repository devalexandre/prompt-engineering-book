## Claude-Specific Prompt Patterns

### Pattern 1: The "Socratic Method" Approach

Claude excels at guided discovery through questions.

```
Help me think through whether to pivot our startup's business model using the Socratic method.

**CURRENT SITUATION:**
- B2B productivity app with slow growth
- Considering pivot to B2C market
- 18 months runway remaining
- Team of 8 people

**SOCRATIC EXPLORATION:**
Instead of giving me direct advice, guide me through the decision by asking probing questions that help me discover the answer myself.

**PROCESS:**
1. Start with fundamental questions about our current situation
2. Ask follow-up questions based on my responses
3. Help me identify assumptions I might be making
4. Guide me to consider perspectives I might be missing
5. Lead me toward my own well-reasoned conclusion

**Begin with your first question to start this exploration.**
```

### Pattern 2: The "Devil's Advocate" Pattern

Claude is excellent at identifying potential problems and counterarguments.

```
I'm excited about launching a new feature for our app. Play devil's advocate to help me identify potential issues I might be overlooking.

**PROPOSED FEATURE:**
- AI-powered email writing assistant
- Integrates with existing productivity app
- Subscription add-on: $15/month
- Target launch: 3 months

**DEVIL'S ADVOCATE ROLE:**
Challenge my assumptions and identify potential problems from these angles:

1. **Technical Risks**: What could go wrong with implementation?
2. **Market Risks**: Why might customers not want this?
3. **Competitive Risks**: How might competitors respond?
4. **Resource Risks**: What if we're underestimating the effort?
5. **Strategic Risks**: Could this hurt our core business?

**For each risk category:**
- Identify the most serious potential problems
- Explain why these problems are likely or concerning
- Suggest what evidence would help validate or dismiss these concerns

**Be thorough in your skepticism while remaining constructive.**
```

### Pattern 3: The "Balanced Synthesis" Pattern

Claude excels at weighing multiple factors and providing balanced conclusions.

```
Help me make a balanced decision about whether to accept a job offer by systematically weighing all relevant factors.

**DECISION FRAMEWORK:**

**JOB OFFER DETAILS:**
- Role: Senior Product Manager at tech startup

**2. FACTOR WEIGHTING**
Guide me through determining the relative importance of each factor

**3. OPTION SCORING**
Help me objectively score how each option (accept/decline) performs on each factor

**4. SCENARIO ANALYSIS**
Consider best-case and worst-case scenarios for each choice

**5. BALANCED SYNTHESIS**
Provide a structured recommendation that acknowledges trade-offs and uncertainties

**Please guide me through this process systematically, helping me think clearly about each element.**

```

### Strategy 2: Iterative Refinement with Self-Assessment

Claude is excellent at improving its own work through structured self-evaluation.

```
**TASK:** Create a comprehensive project timeline for our website redesign.

**INITIAL CREATION:**
First, create a detailed project timeline including all major phases, tasks, dependencies, and milestones.

**SELF-ASSESSMENT:**
Then evaluate your timeline against these criteria:
1. **Completeness**: Are all necessary tasks included?
2. **Realism**: Are time estimates reasonable?
3. **Dependencies**: Are task relationships properly mapped?
4. **Risk Factors**: Are potential delays accounted for?
5. **Resource Allocation**: Is team capacity considered?

**REFINEMENT:**
Based on your self-assessment, create an improved version that addresses any identified weaknesses.

**FINAL VALIDATION:**
Provide a brief explanation of the key improvements made and any remaining uncertainties or assumptions.

**PROJECT CONTEXT:**

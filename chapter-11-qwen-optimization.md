```

#### ✅ Precise Technical Context
```
Optimize this PostgreSQL query for better performance in our e-commerce application:

**CURRENT QUERY:**
```sql
SELECT p.product_id, p.name, p.price, c.category_name, 
       AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating, COUNT(r.rating) as review_count
FROM products p
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.product_id = r.product_id
WHERE p.price BETWEEN 50 AND 500
AND p.created_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name, p.price, c.category_name
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, review_count DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**SYSTEM CONTEXT:**

```
Calculate the ROI of our marketing campaign and verify your work:

**Campaign Data:**
- Total spend: $25,000
- New customers acquired: 150
- Average customer lifetime value: $800
- Campaign duration: 3 months

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**
1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
   - Formula: Total Spend ÷ New Customers
   - Calculation: [Show your work]
   - Result: [CAC value]

2. **Total Customer Value:**
   - Formula: New Customers × Average LTV
   - Calculation: [Show your work]
   - Result: [Total value]

3. **ROI Calculation:**
   - Formula: (Total Value - Total Spend) ÷ Total Spend × 100
   - Calculation: [Show your work]
   - Result: [ROI percentage]

**Verification Check:**
- Does the CAC seem reasonable for our industry?
- Is the ROI calculation mathematically correct?
- Are there any factors I should consider that might affect these numbers?

**Final Assessment:**
Based on the verified calculations, provide your assessment of campaign performance and recommendations.
```

## GPT-Specific Prompt Patterns

### Pattern 1: The "Expert Panel" Approach

GPT excels at simulating multiple expert perspectives in a single response.

```
Convene an expert panel to evaluate our new product launch strategy. Include perspectives from:

**Panel Members:**
1. **Marketing Director** (10 years B2B experience)
2. **Sales Manager** (5 years in our industry)
3. **Product Manager** (8 years product development)
4. **Financial Analyst** (CPA with startup experience)

**Discussion Format:**
Each expert should:
- Provide their perspective on the launch strategy
- Identify their top concern
- Suggest one specific improvement
- Rate the strategy (1-10) from their viewpoint

**Launch Strategy to Evaluate:**
[Include your strategy details]

**Facilitate the discussion, ensuring each expert's voice is distinct and valuable.**
```

### Pattern 2: The "Iterative Refinement" Pattern

GPT can improve its own outputs through structured self-critique.

```
**Task:** Write a compelling subject line for our product launch email.

**Initial Attempt:**
Create 5 subject line options for our new project management software launch.

**Self-Critique:**
Now critique each subject line against these criteria:
- Clarity (is the benefit obvious?)
- Urgency (does it motivate immediate action?)
- Personalization (does it speak to the reader?)
- Length (under 50 characters for mobile?)
- Uniqueness (stands out in crowded inbox?)

Rate each subject line 1-5 on each criterion.

**Refined Version:**
Based on your critique, create 3 improved subject lines that score higher on the most important criteria.

**Final Selection:**
Choose the best subject line and explain why it's optimal for our audience.
```

### Pattern 3: The "Constraint Satisfaction" Pattern

GPT handles multiple constraints well when they're explicitly listed and prioritized.

```
Write a blog post that satisfies ALL of these constraints:

**HARD CONSTRAINTS (Must be met):**
- Exactly 800 words
- Include keyword "project management" 5 times
- Target audience: small business owners
- Include 2 specific statistics with sources
- End with clear call-to-action

**SOFT CONSTRAINTS (Preferred):**
- Conversational but professional tone
- Include one personal anecdote or case study
- Use subheadings for readability
- Include actionable tips

**CONSTRAINT CONFLICTS:**
If constraints conflict, prioritize in this order:
1. Word count and keyword requirements
2. Target audience appropriateness
3. Statistics and credibility
4. Tone and readability

**Topic:** "How Project Management Software Saves Small Businesses Time and Money"

**Before writing, confirm you understand all constraints and how you'll address any potential conflicts.**
```

## Advanced GPT Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Context Window Management

GPT has token limits, so optimize for the most important information first.

```
**PRIORITY INFORMATION (Include first):**
- Core task and objective
- Essential constraints and requirements
- Key context needed for decision-making

**SECONDARY INFORMATION (Include if space allows):**
- Background details
- Nice-to-have requirements
- Additional context

**TERTIARY INFORMATION (Summarize if needed):**
- Historical context
- Tangential information
- Extended examples

**Task:** [Your main request]
**Essential Context:** [Most critical information]
**Additional Details:** [Secondary information]
```

### Strategy 2: Temperature and Creativity Control

Use prompt language to influence GPT's creativity level.

```
**For Highly Creative Tasks:**
"Be creative and think outside the box. Generate unexpected and innovative ideas. Don't limit yourself to conventional approaches."

**For Precise, Factual Tasks:**
"Be precise and accurate. Stick to established facts and proven methods. Avoid speculation or creative interpretation."

**For Balanced Approach:**
"Provide a mix of proven strategies and creative alternatives. Ground your suggestions in evidence but don't be afraid to suggest innovative approaches."
```

### Strategy 3: Error Prevention

Build in safeguards against common GPT errors.

```
**Task:** [Your request]

**Accuracy Safeguards:**
- If you're uncertain about any facts, explicitly state your uncertainty
- For numerical calculations, show your work step-by-step
- For claims about companies or products, note if information might be outdated
- If making assumptions, clearly identify them as assumptions

**Quality Checks:**
Before providing your final answer:
1. Does this directly address the question asked?
2. Are all claims supported or appropriately qualified?
3. Is the response complete and actionable?
4. Have I avoided unnecessary complexity or verbosity?
```

## 🎯 Practice Exercises

# Chapter 8: Prompt Chaining and Workflows

## Building Complex AI Workflows

Prompt chaining is the art of connecting multiple AI interactions to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks. Instead of trying to solve everything in one massive prompt, you break the work into logical stages where each step builds on the previous results.

## Understanding Prompt Chaining

**Traditional Approach:** One complex prompt trying to do everything
**Chaining Approach:** Multiple focused prompts, each with a specific purpose

**Benefits:**
- Better accuracy on each individual step
- Easier to debug and improve
- More reliable and predictable results
- Ability to handle very complex workflows

## Basic Chaining Patterns

### Pattern 1: Linear Chain

Each step depends on the previous step's output.

```
Step 1: Research → Step 2: Analysis → Step 3: Recommendations → Step 4: Implementation Plan
```

### Example: Market Entry Strategy

```
**Step 1: Market Research**
You are a market research analyst. Research the German market for our meal delivery app:

Company context: US-based meal delivery service, 2M users, $50M revenue
Focus areas:
- Market size and growth rate
- Key competitors and their market share
- Regulatory requirements
- Consumer preferences and behavior
- Pricing expectations

Provide a structured report with data and sources.

---

**Step 2: Competitive Analysis** (Input: Step 1 results)
You are a competitive intelligence specialist. Based on this market research: [Step 1 output]

Analyze our competitive position:
- Direct and indirect competitors
- Their strengths and weaknesses
- Market gaps and opportunities
- Our potential competitive advantages
- Threats to be aware of

Create a competitive landscape map and SWOT analysis.

---

**Step 3: Strategy Development** (Input: Steps 1-2 results)

Develop our market entry strategy:
- Target customer segments
- Value proposition for German market
- Go-to-market approach

- Localization requirements

Provide 3 strategic options with pros/cons.

---

**Step 4: Implementation Planning** (Input: Steps 1-3 results)

Create a detailed implementation plan:
- Timeline with key milestones
- Resource requirements
- Budget estimates
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and KPIs

Format as a project roadmap.
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Processing

Multiple independent analyses that converge into a final synthesis.

```
Branch A: Technical Analysis
Branch B: Financial Analysis  
Branch C: Market Analysis
         ↓
    Synthesis Step
```

### Example: Product Launch Decision

```
**Branch A: Technical Feasibility**
You are a CTO evaluating technical readiness for launching our AI writing assistant.

Assess:
- Current system capabilities vs. requirements
- Infrastructure scalability for 10x user growth
- Security and compliance readiness
- Development timeline for missing features
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies

**Branch B: Financial Analysis**
You are a CFO analyzing the financial aspects of launching our AI writing assistant.

Evaluate:
- Development and launch costs
- Revenue projections for first 18 months
- Break-even timeline
- Funding requirements
- Financial risks and scenarios

**Branch C: Market Readiness**
You are a CMO assessing market conditions for launching our AI writing assistant.

Analyze:
- Target market size and segments
- Competitive landscape and positioning
- Marketing strategy and budget needs
- Customer acquisition cost estimates
- Market timing and external factors

**Synthesis: Launch Decision**
You are the CEO making the final launch decision. Based on these three analyses: [All branch outputs]

Provide:
- Go/No-Go recommendation with reasoning
- If Go: Priority actions and timeline
- If No-Go: What needs to change and when to reassess
- Key assumptions and monitoring plan
```

### Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement

Each iteration improves on the previous version based on specific criteria.

```
Draft 1 → Feedback → Draft 2 → Feedback → Draft 3 → Final Version
```

### Example: Policy Development

```
**Iteration 1: Initial Draft**
You are an HR policy writer. Create a first draft of our remote work policy.

Requirements:
- Cover eligibility, approval process, expectations
- Address security and communication requirements
- Include performance management considerations
- Keep it under 2 pages

**Iteration 2: Legal Review**
You are an employment lawyer reviewing this remote work policy: [Draft 1]

Identify:
- Legal compliance issues
- Missing required elements
- Potential liability risks
- Recommended changes for legal protection

Provide specific revision suggestions.

**Iteration 3: Manager Feedback**
You are a department manager reviewing this policy: [Draft 1 + Legal feedback]

Evaluate from a practical management perspective:
- Clarity of expectations and processes
- Enforceability of requirements
- Impact on team management
- Missing operational details

Suggest practical improvements.

**Iteration 4: Final Version**
You are the policy writer creating the final version. Incorporate feedback from legal and management reviews: [All previous feedback]

Create the final policy that is:
- Legally compliant
- Practically manageable
- Clear and comprehensive
- Ready for employee handbook
```

## Advanced Chaining Strategies

### Strategy 1: Conditional Branching

The workflow path depends on intermediate results.

```
**Step 1: Initial Assessment**
Evaluate customer complaint severity:

Complaint: [Customer message]

Classify as:
- Level 1: Simple inquiry (FAQ response)
- Level 2: Standard issue (standard resolution)
- Level 3: Complex problem (escalation needed)

**Conditional Step 2A: Level 1 Response**
[If Level 1] Generate FAQ-style response...

**Conditional Step 2B: Level 2 Resolution**
[If Level 2] Create standard resolution plan...

**Conditional Step 2C: Level 3 Escalation**
[If Level 3] Prepare escalation brief for senior support...
```

### Strategy 2: Quality Gates

Each step includes validation before proceeding.

```
**Step 1: Content Creation**
Write blog post about [topic]

**Quality Gate 1: Content Review**
Review the blog post for:
- Accuracy of information
- Clarity and readability
- SEO optimization
- Brand voice consistency

Pass/Fail decision with specific feedback.

**Step 2: Revision** (Only if Quality Gate 1 = Pass)
[If Pass] Proceed to formatting and publication prep
[If Fail] Revise based on feedback and re-submit to Quality Gate 1
```

### Strategy 3: Feedback Loops

Incorporate external input at specific points.

```
**Step 1: Initial Proposal**
Create marketing campaign proposal

**Human Review Point**
[Human provides feedback on proposal]

**Step 2: Revised Proposal**
Incorporate human feedback: [Feedback provided]
Create revised proposal addressing all concerns

**Step 3: Implementation Plan**
Based on approved proposal, create detailed implementation plan
```

## Workflow Design Principles

### Principle 1: Single Responsibility

Each step should have one clear purpose.

**Good:**
```
Step 1: Extract key data from customer feedback
Step 2: Categorize feedback by theme
Step 3: Prioritize themes by frequency and impact
Step 4: Generate action plan for top 3 themes
```

**Poor:**
```
Step 1: Analyze customer feedback and create action plan
```

### Principle 2: Clear Handoffs

Make explicit what information passes between steps.

**Good:**
```
**Step 1 Output Format:**
- Customer segment: [Primary/Secondary/Tertiary]
- Pain points: [List of 3-5 specific issues]
- Urgency level: [High/Medium/Low]
- Recommended next action: [Specific action]

**Step 2 Input:** Uses the exact output format from Step 1
```

**Poor:**
```
Step 1: Analyze the customer data
Step 2: Use the analysis to create recommendations
```

### Principle 3: Error Handling

Plan for what happens when steps fail or produce unexpected results.

```
**Step 2: Data Analysis**
Analyze the customer data from Step 1.

**Error Handling:**
- If data is incomplete: Request specific missing information
- If data is inconsistent: Flag inconsistencies and ask for clarification
- If analysis is inconclusive: Explain limitations and suggest additional data needed

**Proceed only if:** Analysis confidence level is >70%
```
